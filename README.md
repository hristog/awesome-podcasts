# Awesome Podcasts
Inspired by what has now become a common trend around online open-source communities, I have put together a non-exhaustive list of podcasts which I would recommend to any passionate software engineer, data scientists or perpetual learner out there. A few of them tend to focus mostly on Python, which is non-coincidental, given how widespread the language has become in the Machine Learning and Data Science communities over the past decade.

Please, note that the list is not ordered in any particular way, and even if your language of choice is not Python, there's still quite a lot to be gained in terms of knowledge, as the diversity of topics covered and discussed - along with guests' interests and respective research fields - is unsurprisingly quite vast.

I hope you'll enjoy some of the referenced podcasts! Any feedback, ideas, suggestions and/or contributions are welcome!
