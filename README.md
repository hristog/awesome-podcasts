# Awesome Podcasts
Inspired by what has now become a common trend around online open-source communities,
I have put together a non-extensive list of podcasts which I would recommend to any
passionate software engineer and/or data scientists out there. A few of them tend to
focus mostly on Python, which is non-coincidental, given how widespread the language
has become in the Machine Learning and Data Science communities over the past few years.

Please, note that the list is not ordered in any particular way, and even if your
language of choice is not Python, there's still quite a lot to be gained in terms of
knowledge, as the diversity of topics covered and discussed, along with interests and
research fields of guests, is unsurprisingly quite vast.

Hope you'll enjoy the list. Any ideas, suggestions and/or contributions are welcome!
